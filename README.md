# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
# Task Objectives #
The objective of this project is to develop an efficient machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions from credit card data.
This Colab notebook is structured to guide the user through a complete fraud detection pipeline:

1. Data Loading and Exploration
Load the credit card transaction dataset.
Understand the dataset structure, feature distribution, and class imbalance (fraud vs. non-fraud).
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights.

2. Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values.
Address class imbalance through under-sampling, over-sampling, or SMOTE techniques.
Apply feature scaling and transformations.
Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

3. Model Building and Training
Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) on the preprocessed data.
Optimize models for better fraud detection performance.

4. Model Evaluation
Evaluate using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC metrics.
Visualize model performance with Confusion Matrix and ROC Curves.

5. Code Quality and Documentation
Structured notebook flow with clear section headings.
Detailed in-line comments explaining every major step.
Easy to understand and replicate for future users.
